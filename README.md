1. The doctor is a person who looks after the sick people and prescribes
   medicines so that the patient recovers fast.  In order to become a doctor,
   a person has to study medicine.  Doctors lead a hard life.  Their life
   is very busy. They get up early in the morning and go to the hospital.
   They work without taking a break.  They always remain polite so that
   patients feel comfortable with them.  Since doctors work so hard we must
   realise their value.
